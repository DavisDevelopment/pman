=============

ByteBuffer uses either ArrayBuffers in the browser or Buffers under node.js.

### Browsers: ArrayBuffers

* **[ByteBufferAB.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dcodeIO/ByteBuffer.js/master/dist/ByteBufferAB.js)**
  uses an ArrayBuffer as its backing buffer, accessed through a DataView.
  
* **[ByteBufferAB.min.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dcodeIO/ByteBuffer.js/master/dist/ByteBufferAB.min.js)**
  has been compiled with Closure Compiler using advanced optimizations.
  
* **[ByteBufferAB.min.js.gz](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dcodeIO/ByteBuffer.js/master/dist/ByteBufferAB.min.js.gz)**
  has also been gzipped using `-9`.
  
* **[ByteBufferAB.min.map](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dcodeIO/ByteBuffer.js/master/dist/ByteBufferAB.min.map)**
  is the source map generated by Closure Compiler.

### node.js: Buffers

* **[ByteBufferNB.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dcodeIO/ByteBuffer.js/master/dist/ByteBufferNB.js)**
  uses a node Buffer as its backing buffer.
  
Also available as `bytebuffer` on [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/package/bytebuffer) and
[bower](http://bower.io/search/?q=bytebuffer).

When installed as an [npm package](https://www.npmjs.org/package/bytebuffer), both versions are available.
