## haxe-foundation - Foundation Widgets in Haxe 3.2

The aim of haxe-foundation is to provide a complete, object-oriented interface to the Foundation library, for quickly creating rich user interfaces
in Haxe, for the client-side JavaScript target (of course). Currently only in alpha. Documentation coming soon.
